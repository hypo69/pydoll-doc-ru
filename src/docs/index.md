# Welcome to Pydoll

Hey there! Thanks for checking out Pydoll, the next generation of browser automation for Python. If you're tired of wrestling with webdrivers and looking for a smoother, more reliable way to automate browsers, you're in the right place.

## What is Pydoll?

Pydoll is revolutionizing browser automation by **eliminating the need for webdrivers** completely! Unlike other solutions that rely on external dependencies, Pydoll connects directly to browsers using their DevTools Protocol, providing a seamless and reliable automation experience with native asynchronous performance.

Whether you're scraping data, testing web applications, or automating repetitive tasks, Pydoll makes it surprisingly easy with its intuitive API and powerful features.

## Installation

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) first, then install Pydoll:

<div class="termy">
```bash
$ pip install pydoll-python

---> 100%
```
</div>

For the latest development version, you can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/autoscrape-labs/pydoll.git
```

## Why Choose Pydoll?

- **Genuine Simplicity**: We don't want you wasting time configuring drivers or dealing with compatibility issues. With Pydoll, you install and you're ready to automate.
- **Truly Human Interactions**: Our algorithms simulate real human behavior patterns - from timing between clicks to how the mouse moves across the screen.
- **Native Async Performance**: Built from the ground up with `asyncio`, Pydoll doesn't just support asynchronous operations - it was designed for them.
- **Integrated Intelligence**: Automatic bypass of Cloudflare Turnstile and reCAPTCHA v3 captchas, without external services or complex configurations.
- **Powerful Network Monitoring**: Intercept, modify, and analyze all network traffic with ease, giving you complete control over requests.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to page events, network requests, and user interactions in real-time.
- **Intuitive Element Finding**: Modern `find()` and `query()` methods that make sense and work as you'd expect.
- **Robust Type Safety**: Comprehensive type system for better IDE support and error prevention.


Ready to dive in? The following pages will guide you through installation, basic usage, and advanced features to help you get the most out of Pydoll.

Let's start automating the web, the right way! ðŸš€

## Quick Start Guide: A simple example

Let's start with a practical example. The following script will open the Pydoll GitHub repository and star it:

```python
import asyncio
from pydoll.browser.chromium import Chrome

async def main():
    async with Chrome() as browser:
        tab = await browser.start()
        await tab.go_to('https://github.com/autoscrape-labs/pydoll')
        
        star_button = await tab.find(
            tag_name='button',
            timeout=5,
            raise_exc=False
        )
        if not star_button:
            print("Ops! The button was not found.")
            return

        await star_button.click()
        await asyncio.sleep(3)

asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates how to navigate to a website, wait for an element to appear, and interact with it. You can adapt this pattern to automate many different web tasks.

??? note "Or use without context manager..."
    If you prefer not to use the context manager pattern, you can manually manage the browser instance:
    
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from pydoll.browser.chromium import Chrome
    
    async def main():
        browser = Chrome()
        tab = await browser.start()
        await tab.go_to('https://github.com/autoscrape-labs/pydoll')
        
        star_button = await tab.find(
            tag_name='button',
            timeout=5,
            raise_exc=False
        )
        if not star_button:
            print("Ops! The button was not found.")
            return

        await star_button.click()
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        await browser.stop()
    
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
    
    Note that when not using the context manager, you'll need to explicitly call `browser.stop()` to release resources.

## Extended Example: Custom Browser Configuration

For more advanced usage scenarios, Pydoll allows you to customize your browser configuration using the `ChromiumOptions` class. This is useful when you need to:

- Run in headless mode (no visible browser window)
- Specify a custom browser executable path
- Configure proxies, user agents, or other browser settings
- Set window dimensions or startup arguments

Here's an example showing how to use custom options for Chrome:

```python hl_lines="8-12 30-32 34-38"
import asyncio
import os
from pydoll.browser.chromium import Chrome
from pydoll.browser.options import ChromiumOptions

async def main():
    options = ChromiumOptions()
    options.binary_location = '/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable'
    options.add_argument('--headless=new')
    options.add_argument('--start-maximized')
    options.add_argument('--disable-notifications')
    
    async with Chrome(options=options) as browser:
        tab = await browser.start()
        await tab.go_to('https://github.com/autoscrape-labs/pydoll')
        
        star_button = await tab.find(
            tag_name='button',
            timeout=5,
            raise_exc=False
        )
        if not star_button:
            print("Ops! The button was not found.")
            return

        await star_button.click()
        await asyncio.sleep(3)

        screenshot_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'pydoll_repo.png')
        await tab.take_screenshot(path=screenshot_path)
        print(f"Screenshot saved to: {screenshot_path}")

        base64_screenshot = await tab.take_screenshot(as_base64=True)

        repo_description_element = await tab.find(
            class_name='f4.my-3'
        )
        repo_description = await repo_description_element.text
        print(f"Repository description: {repo_description}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This extended example demonstrates:

1. Creating and configuring browser options
2. Setting a custom Chrome binary path
3. Enabling headless mode for invisible operation
4. Setting additional browser flags
5. Taking screenshots (especially useful in headless mode)

??? info "About Chromium Options"
    The `options.add_argument()` method allows you to pass any Chromium command-line argument to customize browser behavior. There are hundreds of available options to control everything from networking to rendering behavior.
    
    Common Chrome Options
    
    ```python
    # Performance & Behavior Options
    options.add_argument('--headless=new')         # Run Chrome in headless mode
    options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')          # Disable GPU hardware acceleration
    options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')           # Disable sandbox (use with caution)
    options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage') # Overcome limited resource issues
    
    # Appearance Options
    options.add_argument('--start-maximized')      # Start with maximized window
    options.add_argument('--window-size=1920,1080') # Set specific window size
    options.add_argument('--hide-scrollbars')      # Hide scrollbars
    
    # Network Options
    options.add_argument('--proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050') # Use proxy
    options.add_argument('--disable-extensions')   # Disable extensions
    options.add_argument('--disable-notifications') # Disable notifications
    
    # Privacy & Security
    options.add_argument('--incognito')            # Run in incognito mode
    options.add_argument('--disable-infobars')     # Disable infobars
    ```

## Minimal Dependencies

One of Pydoll's advantages is its lightweight footprint. Unlike other browser automation tools that require numerous dependencies, Pydoll is intentionally designed to be minimalist while maintaining powerful capabilities.

### Core Dependencies

Pydoll relies on just a few carefully selected packages:

```
python = "^3.10"
websockets = "^13.1"
aiohttp = "^3.9.5"
aiofiles = "^23.2.1"
bs4 = "^0.0.2"
```

That's it! This minimal dependency approach means:

- **Faster installation** - No complex dependency tree to resolve
- **Fewer conflicts** - Reduced chance of version conflicts with other packages
- **Smaller footprint** - Lower disk space usage
- **Better security** - Smaller attack surface and dependency-related vulnerabilities
- **Easier updates** - Simpler maintenance and fewer breaking changes

The small number of dependencies also contributes to Pydoll's reliability and performance, as there are fewer external factors that could impact its operation.
